# 🎓 AgenticU: The Modular Teaching Hub for Modern LLM Agent Frameworks

Welcome to **AgenticU** — a curated, multi-project teaching repository focused on building modern Agentic AI systems with LLMs.

This project is built from my teaching journeys across Everywhere: in classrooms, workshops, and corporate trainings.  
Inside, you’ll find **hands-on tutorials, code examples, and full project demos** built with the latest frameworks in the LLM agent ecosystem, including:

- LangChain
- LangGraph
- AutoGen
- LlamaIndex
- RAG / CRAG
- OpenAI Function Calling
- More coming soon...

I'll update this repo every week. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. Your Stars are my motivation to continue updating this repo.🤩

## 🧩 What's Inside?

Each folder in this repository is a standalone project or tutorial, covering a specific agentic technique, workflow, or framework.

Some are full applications, others are Jupyter notebook experiments.  
They’re all designed to help you **learn by building**.

Example folders might include:

```
agentic_u/
├── langgraph_agents/
├── autogen_planner/
├── rag_crag_search_demo/
├── openai_function_calling/
├── agentic_ui_streamlit/
├── notebook_demos/
```

## 🙌 A Note to My Previous Supporters

> This is the successor to my original Agentic AI teaching repo,  
> which once had over a thousand stars before it was accidentally deleted.

If you supported that work before — thank you.  
I’m rebuilding it here, even better, and would love your support again ⭐
